# 🛡️ Week 10 — SOC Case Study: Wazuh SIEM Setup & Alert Monitoring

**DG Interns Hub — Cyber Security Internship**

**Intern:** Mah Noor   
**Week:** 10  
**Date:** 28 October 2026

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and monitoring a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab using **Wazuh SIEM, Snort IDS, and Ubuntu 24.04** in an isolated VirtualBox environment.

The objective was to configure centralized security monitoring, generate controlled security events, investigate alerts, and understand how host-based and network-based detections support incident response.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Wazuh 4.14.9** — SIEM and security monitoring
- **Snort IDS** — Network traffic detection
- **Ubuntu 24.04** — Monitored endpoint
- **Amazon Linux 2023** — Wazuh server environment
- **Oracle VirtualBox** — Virtual lab environment
- **Nmap** — Network and port discovery
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — Threat technique mapping

## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed

- Set up the Wazuh server, manager, indexer, and dashboard.
- Installed and registered the Wazuh agent on the Ubuntu endpoint.
- Generated controlled authentication, network, and file-integrity events.
- Investigated failed SSH login attempts involving a non-existent username.
- Analyzed Wazuh rules **5710** and **5503** for SSH and PAM authentication failures.
- Integrated Snort alert logs with Wazuh for centralized monitoring.
- Reviewed alert severity, investigated events, and documented incident response steps.

## 🚨 Key Findings

- Monitored **358 events/alerts** in the Wazuh Threat Hunting view.
- Investigated simulated SSH login attempts using the username `wronguser`.
- Confirmed that the tested login attempts failed, with no account compromise.
- Observed Snort IDS alerts inside the Wazuh dashboard.
- Mapped the password-guessing behavior to **MITRE ATT&CK T1110 — Brute Force**.
- Explored containment, SSH hardening, log verification, and continuous monitoring.

*Note: Alert totals and severity counts come from different Wazuh dashboard views and time windows.*

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Ethical Hacking Lab Practices
- SIEM Configuration and Monitoring
- Threat Hunting and Log Analysis
- Network Intrusion Detection
- Incident Investigation and Response
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## 🔐 Lab Safety

All simulated attack activity was performed within an authorized, isolated VirtualBox lab using a host-only network. The SSH login attempts were controlled tests conducted for defensive monitoring and investigation.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This hands-on project strengthened my understanding of how security monitoring tools detect suspicious activity, correlate host and network events, and support incident investigation.

**The hunt continues!** 🛡️
